#               Data types
# ======================================== #
# === Vectors === #
# Vectors are ordered collection containing the same data type
c(1,2,3)
c(1,2,3)^2
c("Swe", "Eng")
c(TRUE, FALSE)
c(1, "Swe")     # All values will be converted to character types
# Indexing vectors
x <- c('a', 'b', 'c')
x[c(1,1,3)]     # Vectors can be indexed with vectors

# === Scalars === #
# In R, single values are called scalars
15
"Swe"
TRUE

# === Matrices === #
# Matrices are two dimensional array of elements
x <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)

# Finding dimensions of a matrix
dim(x)

# Indexing matrices
x[3,2]     

# Setting and getting col and row names of matrices
colnames(x) <- c("Grade", "Temp", "Hometown")
rownames(x) <- c("Person 1", "Person 2", "Person 3")
colnames(x)
rownames(x)

# Matrices can be plotted easily with barplot
barplot(x, legend=TRUE, col=1:3)
barplot(x, beside=TRUE, legend=TRUE, col=1:3)

# =============== Arrays =============== #
# Arrays are like matrices, but can contain more dimensions
# dim = (height, width, depth)
x <- array(1:18, dim=c(3,3,2))

# Finding dimensions of arrays
dim(x)

# Arrays can be indexed
x[3,1,2]

# =============== Lists =============== #
# Lists are like vectors, but can contain different data types
x <- list(1, "Swe", TRUE)
# We have to use bracket square operator to retrieve values from lists
x[[1]]

# =============== Data Frame =============== #
# A data frame is a list of vectors of equal length
Name <- c("Earth", "Mars", "Pluto")
Diameter <- c(14, 16, 11)
Planets <- data.frame(Name, Diameter)

# Sorting a data frame
Planets[order(Planets$Diameter),]

# =============== Factors =============== #
# Factors take on a limited number of different values. Always use this for categorial values
x <- rep(1:5, 4)
x <- factor(x, levels=1:5, labels=c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'))

# Frequency within factors can be plotted
plot(x, col=2:4)

# =============== Data Table =============== #
# Data tables are better when working with HUGE data. Like 100GB
# Data tables are not native R data types.
library(data.table)

# Reads the .csv file and returns it as a data.table
x <- fread("practice/RealEstate.csv", stringsAsFactors=TRUE)  

# Getting certain rows from data table
x[Bedrooms==4 & Bathrooms > 4]

# Getting a certain column from data table as vector
x[, Price]

# Getting one/several columns from data table as data table
x[, .(Bedrooms, Price)]

# Sorting a data table
x[Bedrooms==4 & Bathrooms > 4][order(Size)]

# Perform operations on data tables
# x[which-row-numbers, function-to-perform, to-group-by]
x[, mean(Price), Location]
x[Bedrooms==3, mean(Price), Location]
x[1:500, sum(Size), Location]
x[, .(Mean_Price_Per_Bathroom=mean(Price/Bathrooms), Total_Size=sum(Size), Count=.N ), by=Location] #.N is the total row count for that group

# We can create/update columns with the := operator
x[, Price_Per_Bathroom:=Price/Bathrooms]
# Or several at the same time
x[, c("Price_Per_Bathroom", "Price_Per_Bedroom"):=.(Price/Bathrooms, Price/Bedrooms)]

# We can create pivot tables. This groups according to formula and performs a function for every group
dcast(x, Location~Status, fun.aggregate = sd, value.var="Price", na.rm=TRUE)

# ======================================== #
#                  Manipulating data
# ======================================== #

# ========== apply family ========== #
# Apply family function can be used instead of for loops
apply(faithful, 2, mean)      # Perform function mean over all columns in data faithful
apply(faithful, 1, sd)        # Perform function mean over all rows in data faithful
lapply(faithful, mean)        # Perform mean for every value in faithful.
# since faithful has two values, namely two lists with values,
# lapply will return the mean for both of those lists
sapply(faithful, mean)        # As lapply, but returns data as a data frame

# This will calculate the mean of the length of teeth, grouped by the dose received by test subjects
tapply(ToothGrowth$len, ToothGrowth$dose, mean)
# More convenient way to work with tapply
with(ToothGrowth, tapply(len, dose, mean))

# Aggregate works like tapply, but accepts a list of columns to group data by
with(ToothGrowth, aggregate(len, list(supp=supp, dose=dose), sd))

# ========== Manipulating data with dplyr ========== #
library(dplyr)
# dplyr is an SQL similar method of manipulating data. 
# It works atleast with data frames and data tables, maybe more
# We can select data
USArrests %>% select(Murder, Assault)

# We can filter on data
USArrests %>% filter(UrbanPop > 80 & Rape < 40)


# ======================================== #
#                  Utilities
# ======================================== #
length(x)       # Returns length of input
class(x)        # Returns class of input
head(x)         # Returns first five values of x
str(x)          # Check the structure of x
table(x)        # Counts occurences of every value in x
order(x)        # Returns which order every index should be in
?mean           # Get help for a method
help(package='ggplot2')           # Get help for a package
rank(x)         # Tells you which position every value is in in the sequence
unique(x)       # Returns all unique values in the sequence
min(x)          # Returns minimum value of x
max(x)          # Returns maximum value of x
range(x)        # Returns the max and the min of x
quantile(x)   

# ========== Generating data ========== #
x = 1:10          # Sequence
seq(0, 100, 10)   # Sequence with specific gap between numbers
rep(x, 10)        # Repeat something
rev(x)            # Reverse something
rbind(1:10, 11:20)  # Creates a matrix from a set of vectors by putting them row by row
cbind(1:10, 11:20)  # Creates a matrix from a set of vectors by putting them column by column

pnorm(0)          # What is the probability of getting one, given the normal distribution
qnorm(0.5)        # What value do we need to have, to atleast 50% of all values? Integral below curve

runif(5)          # Generates 5 values according to the uniform distribution (everything as likely)


# ========== Assignment operators ========== #
# Local scope
x <- 1
x = 1
1 -> x
# Global scope
x <<- 1
1 ->> x


# ========== normal loops and statements ========== #
for(i in 1:10) {
  cat(paste(i, ': '))
  if(i >= 8) 
    cat("Value is 8 or bigger\n")
  else if(i >= 3) 
    cat("Value is between 3 and 8\n")
  else 
    cat(paste("Hello from iteration ", i, '\n'))
}

# Creating a function
x <- function(a, b) {
  a + b
}; x(1,4)

# You cannot access variables from functions if they do not use the global scope assignment operator
a <- 1; x <- function(a) {
  a <- a
}; x(5); a

# You have to use the global scope assignment operator to assign to global scope
a <- 1; x <- function(a) {
  a <<- a
}; x(5); a

# To return things from functions, use the return() method
x <- function() {
  return(25)
}; x()


# ========== input/output ========== #
print("This will print a new line")
cat("This will print without a new line")
paste("This will be concatenated", "with this string")

# Reads a .csv file and returns it as a data.frame
read.csv("practice/RealEstate.csv", header=TRUE)         # header=TRUE --> first row contains column names

# A quicker version of read.csv that instead returns a data.frame. Good for huge data sets
library(data.table)
fread("practice/RealEstate.csv", stringsAsFactors=TRUE)

# We can read .RDS files which loads a serialized R object
x <- readRDS('exercises/6_exercise/KOR_adm1.rds')

#           Hypothesis Testing
# ======================================== #
# Hypothesis testing is used to determine the probability that a hypothesis is true
# The null hypothesis is ALWAYS that there is NO significant difference between the data
# The alternate hypothesis is that there IS a significant difference between the data
# alpha = the level of significance 
# If p < 0.05, we can usually say that the values are significantly different,
# Then we can discard the null hypothesis

# =============== Two sample t-test =============== #
# t-tests compares means between two groups and looks if they are significantly different
# numeric~grouping. 
# expend in this case is the numeric column, which is used to calculate the means
# stature in this case is the column that is used to group the rows. It must have exactly two values
t.test(expend~stature, data=ISwR::energy)


# ======================================== #
#             Contingency tables
# ======================================== #
# Contingency tables are used to count occurences within data. They make it possible
# to find out occurences based on grouping. The table will have as many dimensions as 
# grouping variables we use

# xtabs accepts a formula on the form numeric~grouping. If you leave numeric empty, it will count rows

# =============== One way contingency tables =============== #
# One way tables are when the contingency table has one dimension
xtabs(~cyl, data=mtcars)              # Counts row count per unique value of cyl
xtabs(hp~cyl, data=mtcars)            # Sums all hp for every unique value of cyl

# =============== Two way contingency tables =============== #
# Two way tables is when the contingency table has two dimension
xtabs(hp~cyl+gear, data=mtcars)       # Sums all hp for every unique combination of cyl and gear

# =============== Three way contingency tables =============== #
# Three way table is when the contingency table has three dimensions
x <- xtabs(Freq ~ Hair+Eye+Sex, data=data.frame(HairEyeColor)); x
# It can be hard to reason about this output. We can pretty print like this
ftable(x)

# =============== Inspecting contingency tables =============== #

# ======================================== #
#             Chi square tests
# ======================================== #
# Chi square tests is a form of hypothesis testing. Null hypothesis is always that the 
# data is equally distributed
# Chi square tests are used to see whether an observed frequency distribution 
# differs from a theoretical distribution. 
# With this, we can see if a data is significantly different from each other
# We can call this a Test of Goodness of Fit

# If the p-value < 0.05 we can discard the null hypothesis which means that the 
# we can assume that the data is not equally distributed

# The Chi-square value is often times called X^2

# Expected frequency: E = n/# of categories (perfectly even distribution)

# =============== One way chi square tests =============== #
# One way chi square tests are used on one way contingency tables
# Degree of freedom: df = #categories - 1
x <- xtabs(count~spray, data=InsectSprays)
chisq.test(x)
# p-value =2.2e-16 is way smaller than 0.05, so the data is not equally distributed


# =============== Two way chi square tests =============== #
# Two way chi square tests are used on two way contingency tables
# Degree of freedom: df = #rows-1 * #columns-1

# =============== Finding critical chi squared =============== #
# This returns the critical chi squared value
# 0.95 = accuracy
# 5 = degree of freedom

# =============== Hanging chi gram plot =============== #
# This plots the standard residual for every group.
# It visualizes the how every group differers from the expected
# For one dimensional data

#                  Regression
# ======================================== #
# =============== Linear regression =============== #
# Linear regression creates models which we can use to predict continous values

# =============== Univariate linear regression =============== #
# lm accepts a formula as its first argument. It is on the form y ~ x
x <- lm(Employed ~ GNP, data=longley); x

# =============== Multivariate linear regression =============== #
# For multivariate regression, the formula should be on the form y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + ... xn
x <- lm(Employed ~ GNP + Armed.Forces, data=longley); x

# =============== Logistic regression =============== #
# Logistic regression creates models which we can use to predict the possibility of something
# Odds = p(success) / p(failure)
# Oddsratio for coefficient B1 = e^B1
# The odds ratio tells us that for every one increase in B1, the odds for y = 1 increases by odds ratio times

# =============== Univariate logistic regression =============== #
# Logit(P) = B0 + B1*x. 0 =< P =< 1 
# To get x where p=0.5, -B0/B1

# glm accepts a formula as its first argument. It is on the form y ~ x
x <- glm(badh ~ age, data=LOGIT::badhealth, family=binomial); x
# To calculate the probability of an x, given an univariate logistic 
# regression model use this function
predict.logistic.uni = function(glm, x) {
  return(1/(1+exp(-glm$coefficients[1]-glm$coefficients[2]*x)))
}

# =============== Multivariate logistic regression =============== #
# Logit(P) = B0 + B1*x1 + B2*x2 + ...Bn*xn. 0 =< P =< 1 
# glm accepts a formula as its first argument. It is on the form y ~ x1 + x2 + ... xn

  coefs = glm$coefficients[c(-1)]
  logitP = sum(c(glm$coefficients[1], coefs*x))
  return(1/(1+exp(-logitP)))
}

# We can test the goodness of fit for a logistic regression model 
# If the p-value < 0.05 it means that the model is not a good fit
library(vcdExtra)
HLtest(model=x)


# =============== Inspecting regression models =============== #
# We can inspect a regression model with summary()
# This tells us many things:
# __p-value___
# if p-value < 0.05 the model/relation is significantly correlated
# __Coefficient of determination___
# Also known as R^2. A value between 0 and 1. 
# The larger the value, the better. A value of one means the regression fits the data perfectly

#     Analysis of variance(ANOVA/MANOVA)
# ======================================== #
# ANOVA is used to to investigate relationship between categorial 
# independent variables and continous dependent variables

# ANOVA tests tells us if there is atleast one group which is not like the others
# we do not know if all groups are different thought.
# To get more detailed insight, we have to perform a POST HOC test such as Tukey test

# =============== One way ANOVA =============== #
# One way ANOVA is used to determine if there is a significant difference
# between the means of two or more independent groups
# aov() accepts a forumla as its first input. It is on the form y ~ x
# y is a continous variable
# x is a categorial variable with atleast two groups 
x <- aov(count~spray, data=InsectSprays); x

plot.design(count~spray, data=InsectSprays)         # Plotting
boxplot(count~spray, data=InsectSprays)             # Plotting

# =============== Two way ANOVA =============== #
# aov accepts a formula as its first input. It is on the form y ~ xn
# We can use it in two ways, either we can use the the x's by themselves
# or make an extra x, which is a combination between two x. We call this interaction

# The plus sign adds another x without any interaction
x <- aov(absent~race+school, data=HSAUR3::schooldays); x
summary(x)

# The star sign adds another x with interaction between the surrounding x's
x <- aov(absent~race*school, data=HSAUR3::schooldays); x

# Inspect the p adj columns. Every row where p < 0.05 are significantly different
p <- TukeyHSD(x, conf.level=0.95); p
# We can plot the result for easier consumption
plot(p, las=1)


# =============== MANOVA =============== #
# MANOVA is used to analyze data that has two or more dependant variables 
# and one or more dependant variable

# =============== One way MANOVA =============== #
# One way MANOVA has one independant variable and several dependant
# Therefore, the formula is on the form Y1 + Y2 + ... Yn ~ x
# It is important that Y is a column, therefore we must put it in with the help of cbind
x <- read.csv('practice/ComparingColleges.csv', header=TRUE)
